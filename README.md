# SearchEngine
Search engine using indexing and page ranking as part of COMP 250 project at McGill University, 2015.
## Function
This search engine uses the same underlying (albeit basic) alogrithm Google uses. Indexes all the computer science pages at McGill (cs.mcgill.ca). When given a keyword, looks through all the pages, ranks them in terms of how relevant they are, how authoritative they are, and how reliable they are. Gives the top results.
